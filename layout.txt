Features:

1. graph the amount of funding added into account

2. graph amount of BTC, or ETH I have over time

3. graph value of BTC, or ETH I have over time

4. graph the amount of ETH / BTC I have compared to it's price (chart.js or d3.js)
  4.1 you can do this by keeping a counter var updating the quantity of crypto based on "direction" header id and then multiplying 
      the current counter var by crypto price of the most recent purchase to get the total value of that asset
  4.2 top right you can place an overall % return (green = positive, red = negative) => final asset value / initial asset value
